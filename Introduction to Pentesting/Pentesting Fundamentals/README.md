# TryHackMe – Penetration Testing Fundamentals

## Overview
This room introduces the concepts, ethics, methodologies, and scopes of **penetration testing**. You’ll learn what pentesters do, how they stay within legal and ethical boundaries, and the main frameworks and approaches used in real-world engagements.

---

## Tools Used
_None (conceptual tasks)_

---

## Task 1: What Is Penetration Testing?
A **penetration test** (or “pentest”) is an **authorized**, ethical attempt to break into and analyze an organization’s security defences using the same tools and methods as malicious hackers.

> **Key stat:** Over 2,200 cyber-attacks occur every day—about 1 every 39 seconds (Security Magazine).

---

## Task 2: Penetration Testing Ethics
Before any engagement, the **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** are defined in a formal agreement. They cover:
- **Permission**: Explicit sign-off to test.
- **Scope**: Which systems/applications are in-scope.
- **Rules**: Which techniques are allowed or prohibited.

**Hacker “Hats”**:

| Hat       | Description                                                                 | Example                                    |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| White Hat | Legal, authorized testers who help defend organizations                     | A pentester performing an agreed audit     |
| Grey Hat  | May break rules/ethics but not always the law                                | Takedown of a phishing site without consent|
| Black Hat | Criminal hackers seeking personal/financial gain at others’ expense         | Ransomware author encrypting victim files  |

**Q1:** You are given permission to perform a security audit on an organization.  
**A:** **White Hat**

**Q2:** You attack an organization and steal their data.  
**A:** **Black Hat**

**Q3:** What document defines how a pentest engagement should be carried out?  
**A:** **Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

## Task 3: Penetration Testing Methodologies
All methodologies share these core stages:

| Stage                    | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Information Gathering    | Collect public info (OSINT). No direct scanning.                                                     |
| Enumeration / Scanning   | Discover live services and applications.                                                             |
| Exploitation             | Leverage vulnerabilities to gain initial access.                                                     |
| Privilege Escalation     | Move from limited access to higher privileges (horizontal & vertical).                                |
| Post-Exploitation        | Pivot, data gathering, cover tracks, and report.                                                     |

### Frameworks Overview

| Framework | Focus                                 | Pros                                                       | Cons                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| OSSTMM    | All systems, comms, human aspects     | In-depth, versatile                                        | Complex, heavy definitions                     |
| OWASP     | Web applications                      | Easy to learn, actively maintained                         | No SDLC guidance, no formal accreditation      |
| NIST CSF  | Org-wide risk & control standards     | Widely adopted, detailed                                   | Weak auditing, limited cloud guidance          |
| NCSC CAF  | Critical-services risk assessment     | Gov’t-backed, accreditation                                 | New, less industry uptake                      |

**Q1:** What stage involves using publicly available information?  
**A:** Information Gathering

**Q2:** For pentesting telecommunications, which acronym would you use?  
**A:** **OSSTMM**

**Q3:** Which framework focuses on web application testing?  
**A:** **OWASP**

## Task 4: Black-Box, Grey-Box, White-Box Testing
| Scope      | Knowledge Given                                            | Use Case                             |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Black-Box  | None – tester acts like an external attacker               | Web-UI testing without source access |
| Grey-Box   | Limited – partial knowledge + external testing             | Time-efficient for hardened systems  |
| White-Box  | Full – source code and design details                      | In-depth code review by devs         |

**Q1:** No source code access → **Black-Box**  
**Q2:** Source code provided → **White-Box**

---

## Task 5: Practical: ACME Penetration Test
Completed a full engagement against **ACME’s** infrastructure.

**Answer:** `THM{PENTEST_COMPLETE}`

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Pentests** simulate real-world attacks to strengthen defences.
- Clear scoping and legal agreements (**ROE**) are critical.
- Different frameworks and scopes serve different targets and objectives.
- Hands-on practice (e.g., ACME lab) cements methodology understanding.
