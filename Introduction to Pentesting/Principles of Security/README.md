# Principles of Security 

This repository covers the fundamental principles of information security. It includes the concepts of Defence in Depth, the CIA Triad, security models, and methods of managing access. By understanding these core principles, we can better secure systems, data, and organizational infrastructure.

## Task 1: Introduction

The principles outlined in this guide are part of a broader strategy to secure information systems. One such strategy is **Defence in Depth**, which refers to using multiple layers of security to protect data and systems. Multiple security layers offer redundancy, ensuring that even if one layer fails, other layers continue to provide protection.

## Task 2: The CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is the backbone of information security. It focuses on three key elements:

1. **Confidentiality**
2. **Integrity**
3. **Availability**

These principles form the foundation for creating robust security policies and guidelines. Below is a breakdown of the three elements and their relevance in cybersecurity.

### Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Only authorized parties are allowed to access sensitive data. Common examples include employee records, government documents, and financial information. 

**Example:**
- Sensitive data such as employee records is accessible only by authorized personnel, such as HR administrators. 

### Integrity
Integrity ensures that information is accurate, consistent, and protected from unauthorized modification. To maintain integrity, measures such as encryption, hash verification, and access control are implemented to prevent unauthorized changes.

### Availability
Availability ensures that data and systems are accessible when authorized users need them. This includes the uptime of systems and ensuring that services continue operating without interruptions.

#### Questions from Task 2:

1. **What element of the CIA triad ensures that data cannot be altered by unauthorized people?**
   - Integrity

2. **What element of the CIA triad ensures that data is available?**
   - Availability

3. **What element of the CIA triad ensures that data is only accessed by authorized people?**
   - Confidentiality

## Task 3: Principles of Privileges

Managing access to systems is crucial to ensure that individuals have the appropriate level of permissions to carry out their work. Access control is determined by two main factors:

- **The individual’s role or function within the organization.**
- **The sensitivity of the data or information being accessed.**

### Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM)

**PIM** and **PAM** are two essential concepts for managing access. PIM defines a user’s role within an organization and translates it into specific access rights. PAM, on the other hand, focuses on managing and enforcing those access rights.

#### Questions from Task 3:

1. **What does the acronym "PIM" stand for?**
   - Privileged Identity Management

2. **What does the acronym "PAM" stand for?**
   - Privileged Access Management

3. **If you wanted to manage the privileges a system access role had, what methodology would you use?**
   - PAM (Privileged Access Management)

4. **If you wanted to create a system role based on a user's role/responsibilities within an organization, what methodology is this?**
   - PIM (Privileged Identity Management)

## Task 4: Security Models Continued

### Bell-La Padula Model

The **Bell-La Padula Model** is focused on **Confidentiality** and operates with the "no write down, no read up" rule. This model is widely used in hierarchical organizations such as government and military, where information is highly sensitive.

#### Table: Bell-La Padula Model

| **Advantages**  | **Disadvantages**  |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Policies can be replicated to real-life organizations' hierarchies. | Even though a user may not have access to an object, they may know about its existence. |
| Simple to implement and understand. | Relies on a large amount of trust within the organization. |

### Biba Model

The **Biba Model** is focused on **Integrity** and uses the rule "no write up, no read down". This model ensures that users can write to objects at or below their level but can only read objects above them.

#### Table: Biba Model

| **Advantages**  | **Disadvantages**  |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Simple to implement. | Multiple levels of access can lead to oversights. |
| Resolves confidentiality and data integrity issues. | Can result in delays, e.g., doctors may not read nurse notes. |

#### Questions from Task 4:

1. **What is the name of the model that uses the rule "can't read up, can read down"?**
   - Biba Model

2. **What is the name of the model that uses the rule "can read up, can't read down"?**
   - Bell-La Padula Model

3. **If you were in the military, what security model would you use?**
   - Bell-La Padula Model

4. **If you were a software developer, what security model would the company perhaps use?**
   - Biba Model

## Task 5: Threat Modelling & Incident Response

Threat modeling identifies potential threats to a system or application. It helps improve security protocols and mitigate risks. 

### STRIDE Framework

**STRIDE** is a security threat modeling framework that includes the following principles:

| **Principle**           | **Description**                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spoofing**             | Falsely identifying as another entity.                               |
| **Tampering**            | Altering data or systems maliciously.                                 |
| **Repudiation**          | Denying an action or event.                                           |
| **Information Disclosure** | Unintended exposure of sensitive data.                             |
| **Denial of Service**    | Disrupting the availability of a service or system.                   |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorized access to higher-level privileges.            |

### Incident Response Phases

Incident response is critical in addressing and mitigating security breaches. The six phases of incident response are:

| **Action**        | **Description**                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preparation**    | Ensuring resources and plans are in place to deal with security incidents. |
| **Identification** | Identifying the threat and the threat actor.                         |
| **Containment**    | Containing the threat to prevent further damage.                     |
| **Eradication**    | Removing the active threat from the system.                          |
| **Recovery**       | Returning to business as usual operations.                           |
| **Lessons Learned** | Reviewing the incident and updating protocols to prevent future occurrences. |

#### Questions from Task 5:

   - STRIDE

2. **What does the acronym "IR" stand for?**
