# Metasploit: Exploitation
Using Metasploit for scanning, vulnerability assessment and exploitation.

## Task 1 Introduction
In this room, we will explore how to effectively use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. You’ll learn how to leverage Metasploit’s powerful features to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, and how its integrated database can help streamline and manage penetration testing engagements with a wider scope. Additionally, we’ll cover how to generate payloads using msfvenom and establish a Meterpreter session across various target platforms.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Scanning target systems using Metasploit
- Utilizing the Metasploit database for efficient engagement management
- Performing vulnerability scans with Metasploit
- Exploiting vulnerable services on target systems
- Generating payloads with msfvenom and initiating Meterpreter sessions

Note: For all tasks involving brute-force attacks or other scenarios requiring a wordlist, we will use the predefined wordlist available on the AttackBox at the following path:
/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt

If you are using your own machine, please download the wordlist using the Download Task Files button located to the right of this page.

To follow along, launch the AttackBox and start Metasploit by running the msfconsole command.

## Task 2 Scanning
### Port Scanning

Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the search portscan command.

```bash
msf6 > search portscan

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 7, use 7 or use auxiliary/scanner/http/wordpress_pingback_access
```

Port scanning modules will require to set a few options:

```bash
msf6 > use 5
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   CONCURRENCY  10               yes       The number of concurrent ports to check per host
   DELAY        0                yes       The delay between connections, per thread, in milliseconds
   JITTER       0                yes       The delay jitter factor (maximum value by which to +/- DELAY) in milliseconds.
   PORTS        1-10000          yes       Ports to scan (e.g. 22-25,80,110-900)
   RHOSTS                        yes       The target host(s), see https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html
   THREADS      1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)
   TIMEOUT      1000             yes       The socket connect timeout in milliseconds


View the full module info with the info, or info -d command.

```

**Key Configuration Options:**
- CONCURRENCY: Sets how many targets will be scanned at the same time. Increasing this value can help speed up the scanning process when dealing with multiple systems.
- PORTS: Defines the range of port numbers to be scanned. Note that specifying 1-1000 in Metasploit scans ports 1 through 1000 in order, whereas Nmap (by default) scans the 1000 most commonly used ports, which may not be in order.
- RHOSTS: Indicates the target IP address or network you want to scan.
- THREADS: Determines how many threads will run in parallel during the scan. Using more threads can make the scan faster, but may use more system resources.

You can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > nmap -sS 10.10.249.226
[*] exec: nmap -sS 10.10.249.226

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-05-24 18:15 BST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.38 seconds
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > 
```

While Metasploit may not be the fastest option for port scanning, it still offers several useful modules that make it a valuable tool during the information-gathering phase.

### UDP service Identification
The scanner/discovery/udp_sweep module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) > set RHOSTS 10.10.249.226
RHOSTS => 10.10.249.226
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) > run
[*] Sending 13 probes to 10.10.249.226->10.10.249.226 (1 hosts)
[*] Discovered NetBIOS on 10.10.249.226:137 (ACME IT SUPPORT:<00>:G :ACME IT SUPPORT:<1e>:G :IP-10-10-249-22:<00>:U :IP-10-10-249-22:<03>:U :IP-10-10-249-22:<20>:U :00:00:00:00:00:00)
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) > 
```

### SMB Scans
Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be smb_enumshares and smb_version but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > set  RHOSTS 10.10.249.226
RHOSTS => 10.10.249.226
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run
[*] 10.10.249.226:445     - SMB Detected (versions:1, 2, 3) (preferred dialect:SMB 3.1.1) (compression capabilities:) (encryption capabilities:AES-128-CCM) (signatures:optional) (guid:{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}) (authentication domain:IP-10-10-249-226)
[+] 10.10.249.226:445     -   Host is running Version 6.1.0 (unknown OS)
[*] 10.10.249.226         - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > 

```
When conducting service scans, it's important not to overlook less common services like NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is similar to SMB and allows systems on a network to share files or send data to printers. The NetBIOS name of a target machine can often hint at its function or significance within the network (e.g., names like CORP-DC, DEVOPS, or SALES). You might also discover shared folders or files, some of which could be accessible without a password or protected by weak credentials like admin, administrator, root, or toor.

Metasploit includes a wide range of modules designed to help you better understand your target system and potentially uncover vulnerabilities. It's always a good idea to run a quick search in Metasploit to check for any relevant modules based on what you’ve learned about the target.

### Question 1:
How many ports are open on the target system?

**Answer:** 5

### Question 2:
Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?

**Answer:** ACME IT SUPPORT

```bash
msf6 > search NetBIOS

## Task 3 The Metasploit Database

While it is not required when interacting with a single target on TryHackMe, an actual penetration testing engagement will likely have several targets.

Metasploit has a database function to simplify project management and avoid possible confusion when setting up parameter values.

Please note the following steps have already been taken in the TryHackMe AttackBox, so you will only need to do this if you are using Kali or have installed Metasploit yourself.

You will first need to start the PostgreSQL database, which Metasploit will use with the following command: systemctl start postgresql.

Then you will need to initialize the Metasploit Database using the msfdb init command. However, trying to run msfdb init as root will give the following error message, "Please run msfdb as a non-root user." This can be solved by running it as the postgres account using sudo -u postgres msfdb init.

The terminal below shows the example output. As mentioned, the steps below have already been performed on the AttackBox; however, if you are interested in repeating them, you will need to delete the existing database first using sudo -u postgres msfdb delete.

**Starting Postgresql**
```bash
root@attackbox:~# systemctl start postgresql 
root@attackbox:~# sudo -u postgres msfdb init
Running the 'init' command for the database:
Creating database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db
Creating db socket file at /tmp
Starting database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db...waiting for server to start.... done
server started
success
Creating database users
Writing client authentication configuration file /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db/pg_hba.conf
Stopping database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db
Starting database at /var/lib/postgresql/.msf4/db...waiting for server to start.... done
server started
success
Creating initial database schema
Database initialization successful
root@attackbox:~#
```
You can now launch msfconsole and check the database status using the db_status command.

**Checking the database status**
```bash
msf6 > db_status
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
msf6 >
```

The database feature will allow you to create workspaces to isolate different projects. When first launched, you should be in the default workspace. You can list available workspaces using the workspace command.

**Listing workspaces**
```bash
msf6 > workspace
* default
msf6 >
```

You can add a workspace using the -a parameter or delete a workspace using the -d parameter, respectively. The screenshot below shows that a new workspace named "tryhackme" was created.

**Adding a workspace**
```bash
msf6 > workspace -a tryhackme
[*] Added workspace: tryhackme
[*] Workspace: tryhackme
msf5 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf6 >
```


You will also notice that the new database name is printed in red, starting with a * symbol.

You can use the workspace command to navigate between workspaces simply by typing workspace followed by the desired workspace name.

**Changing workspaces**
```bash
msf6 > workspace
default
* tryhackme
msf5 > workspace default
[*] Workspace: default
msf5 > workspace 
tryhackme
* default
msf6 >
```

You can use the workspace -h command to list available options for the workspace command.

**Workspace help menu**
```bash
msf6 > workspace -h
Usage:
workspace                  List workspaces
workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
workspace [name]           Switch workspace
workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
workspace -r     Rename workspace
workspace -h               Show this help information
```

Different from regular Metasploit usage, once Metasploit is launched with a database, the help command, you will show the Database Backends Commands menu.

**Database backend commands**
```bash
Database Backend Commands

```

If you run a Nmap scan using the db_nmap shown below, all results will be saved to the database.

**The db_nmap command**
```bash
msf6 > db_nmap -sV -p- 10.10.12.229
[*] Nmap: Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-20 03:15 UTC

[*] Nmap: Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
[*] Nmap: Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 94.91 seconds
```

You can now reach information relevant to hosts and services running on target systems with the hosts and services commands, respectively. 

**Hosts and services**
```bash
msf6 > hosts

The hosts -h and services -h commands can help you become more familiar with available options. Once the host information is stored in the database, you can use the hosts -R command to add this value to the RHOSTS parameter.

Example Workflow

We will use the vulnerability scanning module that finds potential MS17-010 vulnerabilities with the use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 command.
We set the RHOSTS value using hosts -R.
We have typed show options to check if all values were assigned correctly. (In this example, 10.10.138.32 is the IP address we have scanned earlier using the db_nmap command)
Once all parameters are set, we launch the exploit using the run or exploit command. 

**Using saved hosts**
```bash
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > hosts -R

If there is more than one host saved to the database, all IP addresses will be used when the hosts -R command is used. 
In a typical penetration testing engagement, we could have the following scenario: 

Finding available hosts using the db_nmap command
Scanning these for further vulnerabilities or open ports (using a port scanning module) 
The services command used with the -S parameter will allow you to search for specific services in the environment.

**Querying the database for services**
```bash
msf6 > services -S netbios

You may want to look for low-hanging fruits such as:

- HTTP: Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- FTP: Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files.
- SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010
- SSH: Could have default or easy to guess credentials
- RDP: Could be vulnerable to Bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used. 

As you can see, Metasploit has many features to aid in engagements such as the ability to compartmentalize your engagements into workspaces, analyze your results at a high level, and quickly import and explore data.
